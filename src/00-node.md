# Running a Node

This guide will walk you through starting or upgrading a full node on the Nomic testnet.

Running a node increases the health of the network by decentralizing ledger validation and data, even for non-validator nodes. Community members are encouraged to run a node, especially when regularly interacting with the network via transactions and queries.

### Need help?
